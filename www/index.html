<H3>1. Overview</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

This library is intended for developers who wish to manipulate (read, parse,
modify, and create) symbolic expressions from C or C++ programs.  A symbolic
expression, or s-expression, is essentially a LISP-like expression such as
<B>(a (b c))</B>.  S-expressions are able to represent complex, structured data
without requiring additional meta-data describing the structure.  They are
recursively defined: an s-expression is a list of either <I>atoms</I> or
s-expressions.  In the example above, the expression contains an atom "a" and
an s-expression, which in turn contains two atoms, "b" and "c".  They are
simple, useful, and well understood.<P>

This library is intended to be a minimal set of functions and structures for
the four functions listed above: reading s-expressions (I/O), parsing strings
containing them into an AST equivalent, modifying the AST representation,
and converting the AST back into a well formatted string.  The primary goals
are <B>efficiency</B> and <B>simplicity</B>.  This library forms the basis
of the data representation and transmission protocol for the
<A HREF="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/supermon/">supermon</A> high-speed
cluster monitoring system from the LANL ACL.  The usefulness and lack of 
choice in available, open source s-expression libraries motivated the
independent (from supermon) release of this library.  Although the number
of potential users represents a rather small community, the author felt
it was a valuable contribution.  As of March 2005, this library has actually
received more interest in terms of downloads and page views than it's
parent project!  <P>
<I>Update July 2007:</I> sfsexp is still ahead of it's
parent project.  Not bad considering that the parent project was published
a few times, part of a 2005 R&D 100 award winning project, and somewhat known
in the high-performance computing community -- while sfsexp
has not been advertised at all!  Cool!<P>

This work was funded by the Department of Energy, Office of Science.
It is currently maintained independently of any funding source for
the community.

<H4>1.1. Revision Information</H4>

Starting with version 1.2 (October 2007), I will provide documentation
of the most recent revisions here.  Detailed notes are available from
the file releases and news items, but the most important items will be
highlighted here.


<B> Version 1.1 -> 1.2 </B><P>

<UL>
<LI>Introduction of <tt>sexp_errors.h</tt>, corresponding
  <tt>sexp_errcode_t</tt> type, the library errno variable
  <tt>sexp_errno</tt> and the <tt>error</tt> field in the
  <tt>pcont_t</tt> structure.  This is the biggest revision to the
  library.  Instead of asserting or <tt>fprintf()</tt> and exiting,
  the library attempts to gracefully return to the caller providing
  error cause information via the <tt>sexp_errno</tt> and error
  fields.</LI>

<LI>Removed deprecated functions, removed testers for corresponding
  functions.  Functions removed were <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>car</tt> and
  <tt>cdr</tt>.</LI>

<LI>Event-based parsing is removed for now from the main source files.
  callbacks still exist, but the full parser based on events was
  removed.  the original implementation essentially required a
  duplicate <tt>parse_sexp()</tt> function, which seemed like a recipe
  for version skew and disaster.  this limits the ability to parse
  infinite streams of s-expressions, but I'd rather get it right than
  to have the suboptimal solution in the distribution.  the code is
  still available in the <tt>src/event_temp.c</tt> file, but not in
  the main parser files.</LI>

<LI> Revised comments and documentation to reflect my new location at
  the University of Oregon, Computer Science Department after departing
  Los Alamos National Laboratory in September 2007.</LI>

<LI> Patched multiple bugs related to missed <tt>NULL</tt> checks and
  memory management issues.  Most users will not have encountered these,
  as many occurred in unusual circumstances.</LI>

<H3>2. Use Cases</H3>

The two most appropriate and common uses of this library are for data
structure representation and network protocols.  It's a trivial step
from a data structure (C struct, C++ class, or F95 user-defined type)
to s-expression representation.  For example, the following are very easy
to represent as s-expressions:

<UL>
<LI>Trees
<LI>Arbitrary directed or un-directed graphs
<LI>Lists
<LI>Dictionaries, or hash-tables
</UL>

Quite often one will want to have a way to save and restore structures
to and from disk, or transmit a data structure over a network between
two applications.  This naturally leads to network protocols where
structurally non-trivial data is passed back and forth.  The
s-expression allows data to be stored internally in a format that
mimics the original data structure, and transmitted in an efficiently
parsed and unparsed format.  Furthermore, this library extends the
basic s-expression to allow inlined binary data, removing the need to
encode binary data (such as images) before sending.  Such binary
payloads are easily encapsulated in the s-expression format without
marshalling to ASCII or other non-binary formats.<P>

Furthermore, data structures sent over the wire as s-expressions are
not prone to differences in architecture.  Unlike systems that send
pure binary and are based on the assumption that structures are laid
out consistently between languages and platforms, the s-expression is
<I>portable</I> with minimal overhead to achive this portable
representation.  There is an innevitable trade-off in byte efficiency 
with s-expressions versus raw-binary, but unlike other representations (such
as XML) it is mininal.  Parsing is also simpler than XML or other 'document
markup languages'.  Also note that portability goes out the window with
inlined binary, at least in terms of byte ordering. <P>

Example uses of this library that have been made available to the author
include:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Tools for teaching high-school geometry (examples/simple_interp.c)
<LI>Interpreters for subsets of LISP or Scheme
<LI>Neural network state storage and retrieval
<LI>Simulation geometry setup for cellular automata
<LI>"Input deck" parameter files for simulations
<LI>Wire protocol for cluster monitoring (Supermon)
<LI>Wire protocol for transmitting image data from source to processor.

<H3>3. Implementation details</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
An s-expression is an expression composed of elements that are either
atoms or s-expressions.  For example, the following are s-expressions
containing two elements:

<PRE>
    (a b) 
    (a (b c))
    ((a b) (c d))
    (() ())
</PRE>

In the first case, the s-expression contains two atoms, the strings "a" and
"b".  The second example is contains an atom and another s-expression (which
contains two atoms).  The third example is composed of two other s-expressions.
The final contains two empty s-expressions.

One possible representation of these expressions is as nested lists, where
a single element of a list is captured in the structure:

<PRE>
    struct elt {
      int type;
      char *val;
      struct elt *list; 
      struct elt *next;
    };
</PRE>

Since an element can be either a list or atom, the element structure has a
type indicator that can be either LIST or VALUE.  If the type indicator is
LIST, then the structure member "list" will be a pointer to the head of the
list represented by this element.  If the type indicator is VALUE, then the
structure member "val" will contain the atom represented by the element
as a string.  In both cases, the "next" pointer will point at the next element
of the current s-expression.

The following rough illustration shows how the expression (a (b c)) is 
translated to the structures above.

<PRE>
+----+------+-------+
|LIST|list=o|next=o--->NULL
+----+-----|+-------+
           |
   +-------+
   |
   v
+-----+-------+-------+  +----+------+-------+
|VALUE|val="a"|next=o--->|LIST|list=o|next=o--->NULL
+-----+-------+-------+  +----+-----|+-------+
                                    |
                         +----------+
                         |
                         v
                     +-----+-------+-------+  +-----+-------+-------+
                     +VALUE|val="b"|next=o--->|VALUE|val="c"|next=o--->NULL
                     +-----+-------+-------+  +-----+-------+-------+
</PRE>

(note: o--->   represents a pointer)

The actual structures are slightly more complex to deal with variable size
values in atoms, but those fields aren't necessary to express the basic
idea of the structures.<P>

<I><B>New! (12/20/04)</B></I>: A new function, <tt>sexp_to_dotfile()</tt> has
been added to allow visualization of the sexp_t structures that represent
the s-expressions using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</A>.  
This is very useful for debugging.  To further illustrate how the structure
of an s-expression is represented by the library, the
<A HREf="sexpexample.png">example available here</A> shows the structure
corresponding with the following:<P>

<H3>5. Questions</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Why is it called "Smaller"?</B><BR> 

Well, when I initially started looking for a way to manipulate
s-expressions from C, I found some libraries that existed.
Unfortunately, they were big.  All I wanted was the ability to take a
string representation of an s-expression, turn it into a linked data
structure that is easy to walk and modify in C, and then turn that
back into a string.  So, this library lets you do exactly that.  It's
a bit bigger than before, but for most purposes a developer will only
use three or four of the routines it provides - parse, print, destroy,
and find.  Others exist for different types of parsing or operations
on the linked sexp_t data structure, but they're not necessary for
all users.<P>

<B>What is a continuation?</B><BR>

Many definitions probably exist out there for this, and most people
have likely seen continuations in languages like Scheme, ML, or others
that have a little function called <tt>callcc</tt>.  The idea is that
a continuation represents state - in our case, the continuation
contains the state of the parser when it exits.  For example, if you
have a very large s-expression being read off of a socket, you might
not get the entire string in a single read call.  Now, you can either
accumulate the string into a buffer until it is complete, or you can
tell the parser to start parsing the incomplete string.  The trick is,
when the next string-chunk comes in, you want to tell the parser
"here's more data, and pick up where you left off."  This involves
restoring the stack the parser uses to put the linked structures onto
while it works, restore the proper state (IE: was it parsing a simple
atom or a quoted string?), and do other things to get it going again.
Once the continuation has restored the state, the parser picks up and
acts just like it would as if the whole s-expression string had been
passed in at once.  Clear?  If not, you *probably* don't need to use
this feature.  In our case, we wanted to have multiple sockets all
providing partial s-expressions, so the parser had to 1) not have any
global state and 2) be able to pick up where each socket left off on
each incomplete string.  In addition, it had to be able to do this
with minimal performance loss.  So, we have a continuation based
parser that takes a continuation and returns one, and the contents of
the structure tell you about the state of the parser and the string
being parsed.<P>

<B>Why would I use this library instead of just using
LISP/Scheme/Emacs/etc.?</B><BR>

A few reasons - it's small, it has a tiny API, and it is fast.  It
isn't a language interpreter.  It is just a way of efficiently
manipulating LISP like expressions in a language like C.  How many
times have you wished for a <tt>cons</tt> operator in C?  Or maybe a
way of having lists of lists and atoms that was easy to deal with?
Well, s-expressions are good for that.  How about structured data?  A
tree in s-expression land is trivial to represent, as are more complex
structures.  In many ways, the structure of an s-expression might look
close to XML, with parentheses in place of angle-bracketed tags.  If
you have an application that wants to pass around, parse, and
manipulate complex data structures in a platform independent
(non-binary) way, s-expressions are the easy way to do it.  And again,
they're fast.  Oh yes, since you can create valid s-expressions with
this library, there's no reason why you can't just feed them to a
program in LISP or Emacs and start using them from there.  It might
involve a strategically placed <tt>setq</tt> or the like, but it's
easy.<P>

<B>Why not XML?</B><BR>

The goal of any project should be to solve a problem in an elegant, well
designed manner.  Buzzword compliance rarely achieves this, other than 
allowing a lowly programmer or software engineer to appease higher-ups
who read that "XML is the latest great thing!"  XML suffers from
certain flaws that make it worthless in an environment where speed and
efficiency (memory and time complexity) are key requirements.  Compare
the performance, footprint, and developer complexity of Xerces and this
s-expression library, and you'll see that for hierarchical data
representation, one is significantly simpler than the other without losing
the ability to do its job (represent data!).  After working with XML for
a while (~3-4 years) on multiple projects, I find that since starting to
use s-expressions again as a data format has allowed me to spend less time
debugging my data representation code and more time on problems that
matter.  <P>

<B>How fast is this library?</B><BR>

<B><I>Updated 11/5/02</I></B>:  I've been meaning to update the
answer to this question for a while.  The library has undergone many
optimizations since continuations were added, including self-contained
memory management to avoid excessive malloc/free calls.  The while
loop of the parser now really does examine each character just once.
Testing using the <TT>{c}torture.c</TT> tester included with the package
yielded these results, which I give for each version released for
comparison.<P>

Each iteration of the test would parse the expression, unparse the AST
back into a string and destroy the AST.  This was performed 1,000 times
and the required time averaged over 5 runs is shown above.  Version
0.3.0 has every optimization thus far applied, although the one that
proved most beneficial was the efficient memory management addition.
Version 0.3.1 is slightly slower due to memory allocation operations that
do NOT take advantage of the faster memory management but were added
to remove the need for fixed-length buffers in sexp_t elements.
<P>

<B>So why is this project on sourceforge?</B><BR>
To tell the truth, it's not really necessary to have it up here but I did
so for two big reasons:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>I wanted to learn how to use sourceforge before putting a really big,
complicated project up on it.
<LI>The library is useful for more than just supermon - so if anyone wants
to play with it, they can get the standalone version.
</OL><BR>
So there it is.<P>

<B>Why did you bother writing this?</B><BR>

This is one of those annoying questions that pops up occasionally.  A
quick search on google yields only one other obvious candidate: <A
HREF="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sexp.html">Rivest's SEXP
Library</A>.  A quick look at the example code and guide to using this
library shows that his library is far more complex due to it's purpose
in cryptographic applications.  All other references that I found for
libraries to deal with s-expressions from C or C++ involve embedding
GUILE or some other scheme/LISP interpreter in the application.  For
most purposes, this is overkill.  In other languages, solutions exist.
For example, in Java, the W3C web pages have references to a java
package for dealing with s-expressions.  In LISP or Scheme, the answer
is obvious.  In ML, a basic translation of LISP to ML should work fine
since ML lists act in many ways like s-expressions.  So no, this
library isn't a waste of time in my opinion.  Besides, how many times
have you found many implementations of things like arbitrary precision
arithmetic, window managers, GUI toolkits, etc...  Each has its place
and purpose and was written for a real reason.  A final reason is that
it is doubtful that many (if any) other s-expression parsers support
continuations or some other form of partial parsing to be implemented.
This is exceptionally useful when parsing off of a socket stream where
the programmer doesn't have the space or desire to wait until the
entire expression has been received before starting the parsing
process.<P>

<B>Why is an unquoted word not a valid atom on its own?</B><BR>

The following are atoms that do not exist within parenthesis:<P>
<OL>
<LI>"example one"
<LI>'(example two)
<LI>example_three
</OL><P>

The first and second are valid and will be returned if those string are
passed into the parser.  Furthermore, they can be parsed and unparsed
repeatedly and remain valid and unchanged over a number of iterations.
The third example will ONLY parse if the last character of the string is
whitespace or a carriage return.  This is the only way to cue the parser into
knowing that the string is in fact complete, and not to wait to see if the
next call with the current continuation will introduce more characters to
parse.  Unfortunately, since whitespace and carriage returns are not considered
part of the atom itself, when an atom is parsed that is followed by those
characters, they do not appear in the unparsed version of that atom!  This
means that although it is possible to parse an expression such as:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>simple_atom\n</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Unparsing it will result in:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>simple_atom</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Which will not parse to the same result as the first.  This is valid
behaviour due to the semantics of the continuation based parser.
<P>

<B>My code crashes in the parser with a core dump, segementation fault,
assertion, or mysterious parser error message.</B><BR>

First, make sure you're passing a valid s-expression in.  If this is the
case (or you believe it to be the case), send me the s-expression
and the code (or some code) that can reproduce the error.  A note saying
"the parser died with such-and-such error message" is of little use
in tracking the problem.  I'm not psychic!  :)
