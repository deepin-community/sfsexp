This directory contains bindings for SILOON, allowing testing of the library
from Python or Perl instead of through the existing C interface alone.

SILOON can be found at http://www.acl.lanl.gov/siloon/

This is NOT intended for real use, and the author (Matt) won't even respond
to support questions.  It was an experiment, and still is.  (And hasn't been
looked at in months.)
